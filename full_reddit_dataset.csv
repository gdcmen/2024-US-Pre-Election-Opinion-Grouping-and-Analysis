I live to serve, it’s what led me to the Air Force and it’s what’s motivating my canandicy now. I cannot sit on the sidelines witnessing suffering if it feels there’s something I can do to alleviate it.

I was so inspired by Andrew Yang, his authenticity and compassion was enough to get me to give the Freedom Dividend a second look because I was NOT a fan at first. But the more I studied, the more curious I got and the more it made sense. It took awhile for me to come around but now I’m all in.

I am so grateful for all the hard work and sacrifice of everyone who came before me but we’ve been following a false story over a cliff and the ground is coming up fast. It is clear to me that the America my parents and grandparents still dream of is not an America that’s worth leaving to my kids. 

In the Air Force, they taught us to “aim high,” and It is my aim to win the honor of representing Tennessee in the US House of Representatives, to create an environment where my children and yours can live with health, dignity, and financial security.

UPDATE 1:Thanks for all of your questions so far! We will be concluding at 12:30pm, so please send in any last-minute Qs!

UPDATE 2 : Hey, r/politics, thanks for participating! We’re signing off for now, but we’ll be on the lookout for additional questions.

We’re Dr. Jonathan Auerbach, Dr. David Lublin, and Dr. Veronica Reyna, and we’re excited to answer your questions about everything that’s happened since last week’s election. Feel free to ask us about what to expect throughout the rest of this process.
 
I’m Jonathan, and I’m the Science Policy Fellow with the [American Statistical Association](https://www.amstat.org/), the world’s largest community of statisticians. I’ve worked on political campaigns at the local, state, and federal level, and coauthored several papers on statistics and public policy—most recently on [election prediction](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/2020prediction.pdf) and [election security](https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/POL-Vote-by-Mail.pdf). I received my Ph.D. in statistics from Columbia University, where I created and taught the class Statistics for Activists. Ask me anything about the role statistics plays in our elections—or public policy in general.
 
I’m David, and I’m a Professor of Government at American University. I’m also the co-chair of the American Political Science Association’s [Election Assistance Taskforce](https://apsanet.org/Democracy-2020-Campaign/ElectionAssistanceTask-Force), a non-partisan cohort of political scientists that’s focused on encouraging participation and providing a broader understanding for issues related to voting. I like to study and write about how the rules of the political game shape outcomes, especially for minority representation, both in the U.S. and around the world. My three books, Minority Rules, The Republican South, and The Paradox of Representation all make excellent holiday gifts or doorstops. I love maps and traveling to places near and far. Ask me anything about gerrymandering, minority politics, judicial challenges to this election, and why democracy in the U.S. faces ongoing serious challenges.
 
I’m Veronica, and I’m a Professor and Associate Chair of the Department of Government at Houston Community College, as well as the Director at the Center for Civic Engagement. I’m also a colleague of David’s on APSA’s Election Assistance Taskforce. I currently teach American Government, Texas Government, and Mexican American/Latinx Politics. Topics of forthcoming publications include benefits and ethical issues of community engaged research and teaching research methodologies in community college. Ask me anything about political science education, youth mobilization and participation, Latino politics, or justice issues like voter suppression.

1dsupsh,"Megathread: US Supreme Court Finds in Trump v. United States That Presidents Have Full Immunity for Constitutional Powers, the Presumption of Immunity for Official Acts, and No Immunity for Unofficial Acts","On Monday, the US Supreme Court sent the case of Trump v. United States back to a lower court in Washington, which per [AP](https://apnews.com/live/supreme-court-trump-presidential-immunity-updates#00000190-6eb5-d1c9-a1d1-7ff720090000) has the effect of ""dimming prospect of a pre-election trial"".  The majority opinion, authored by Chief Justice Roberts, found that:

>Under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of Presidential power entitles a former President to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority. And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. There is no immunity for unofficial acts.

15fpsf5,"Megathread: Trump Indicted on Third Set of Charges, This Time Related to the January 6th Attack and Associated Efforts to Overturn the 2020 Presidential Election","On Tuesday, former president and current frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination Donald Trump was indicted by a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C. [Source: Associated Press](<https://apnews.com/article/trump-indicted-jan-6-investigation-special-counsel-debb59bb7a4d9f93f7e2dace01feccdc>). The charges include: Conspiracy to Defraud the United States, Conspiracy to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, Obstruction of and Attempt to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, and Conspiracy Against Rights. [You can read the full indictment for yourself here at CourtListener.](<https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_1.pdf>) These charges stem from one of two separate investigations into Trump being conducted by Special Counsel Jack Smith for the US Department of Justice. The first investigation is into the apparent mishandling of highly classified documents after Trump had departed office. This resulted in [37 felony charges](<https://www.npr.org/2023/06/09/1181340894/trump-indictment-classified-documents-charges>) being made public on June 9th of this year, with [3 additional, related charges](<https://www.npr.org/2023/07/29/1190953438/trump-faces-new-charges-in-classified-documents-case>) added last week. Today's charges stem from the second investigation headed by Smith, which is into the January 6th, 2021 attack on the US Capitol and associated efforts within the Trump Administration to illegally overturn Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. The aforementioned investigations into Trump are a separate matter from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's inquiry, which in April resulted in an indictment on [34 counts of falsification of business records](<https://www.npr.org/2023/04/04/1167708172/trump-charges-hush-money-new-york-indictment>). According to Bragg, Trump was part of a scheme to catch and kill"" negative information about himself before and after the 2016 election via hush money payments made via the Trump Organization.  Still outstanding are the results of a fourth probe being conducted by Fani Willis, the District Attorney for Fulton County, Georgia.  That probe is into Trump and others' efforts to overturn Georgia's 2020 presidential election results; an announcement related to DA Willis' probe is [expected sometime later in August](https://apnews.com/article/trump-georgia-election-investigation-fani-willis-d6191037a8993d653686e679bf5e8ea5).

[Source: Associated Press](<https://apnews.com/article/trump-indicted-jan-6-investigation-special-counsel-debb59bb7a4d9f93f7e2dace01feccdc>). The charges include: Conspiracy to Defraud the United States, Conspiracy to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, Obstruction of and Attempt to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, and Conspiracy Against Rights. [You can read the full indictment for yourself here at CourtListener.](<https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_1.pdf>) These charges stem from one of two separate investigations into Trump being conducted by Special Counsel Jack Smith for the US Department of Justice. The first investigation is into the apparent mishandling of highly classified documents after Trump had departed office. This resulted in [37 felony charges](<https://www.npr.org/2023/06/09/1181340894/trump-indictment-classified-documents-charges>) being made public on June 9th of this year, with [3 additional, related charges](<https://www.npr.org/2023/07/29/1190953438/trump-faces-new-charges-in-classified-documents-case>) added last week. Today's charges stem from the second investigation headed by Smith, which is into the January 6th, 2021 attack on the US Capitol and associated efforts within the Trump Administration to illegally overturn Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. The aforementioned investigations into Trump are a separate matter from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's inquiry, which in April resulted in an indictment on [34 counts of falsification of business records](<https://www.npr.org/2023/04/04/1167708172/trump-charges-hush-money-new-york-indictment>). According to Bragg, Trump was part of a scheme to catch and kill"" negative information about himself before and after the 2016 election via hush money payments made via the Trump Organization.  Still outstanding are the results of a fourth probe being conducted by Fani Willis, the District Attorney for Fulton County, Georgia.  That probe is into Trump and others' efforts to overturn Georgia's 2020 presidential election results; an announcement related to DA Willis' probe is [expected sometime later in August](https://apnews.com/article/trump-georgia-election-investigation-fani-willis-d6191037a8993d653686e679bf5e8ea5).

ks9iz4,Megathread: Congress Certifies the 2020 Presidential Election for President-Elect Biden,"Congress has certified the results of the 2020 election, and Vice President Michael R. Pence declared President-Elect Joseph R. Biden the winner, reviewing the ballots cast by electors from each state and voting down objections made to the electors from several swing states. The count had begun at 10AM ET on 1/6, but the storming of the Capitol building by a mob seeking to overturn the results from several states delayed counting in the afternoon. The voting procedure commenced again at 8PM, and ended at 3:42am the following day.

Members of Congress had originally objected to the results from Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania. However, following the violence at the Capitol in the afternoon, Senators withdrew objections to the electoral counts from Georgia, Michigan and Nevada. The objection to the electoral count in Arizona failed 93-6 in the Senate, and 303-121 in the House. The objection to the electoral count in Pennsylvania failed 92-7 in the Senate, and 282-138 in the House. Objections to electoral results can only be sustained upon a majority vote by both Houses of Congress.

The certification is the penultimate procedural hurdle to the validation of the 2020 presidential election, with the final step being President-Elect Biden’s swearing in ceremony and administration of the oath of office on January 20.

Pence declared President-Elect Joseph R. Biden the winner, reviewing the ballots cast by electors from each state and voting down objections made to the electors from several swing states. The count had begun at 10AM ET on 1/6, but the storming of the Capitol building by a mob seeking to overturn the results from several states delayed counting in the afternoon. The voting procedure commenced again at 8PM, and ended at 3:42am the following day.

Members of Congress had originally objected to the results from Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania. However, following the violence at the Capitol in the afternoon, Senators withdrew objections to the electoral counts from Georgia, Michigan and Nevada. The objection to the electoral count in Arizona failed 93-6 in the Senate, and 303-121 in the House. The objection to the electoral count in Pennsylvania failed 92-7 in the Senate, and 282-138 in the House. Objections to electoral results can only be sustained upon a majority vote by both Houses of Congress.

The certification is the penultimate procedural hurdle to the validation of the 2020 presidential election, with the final step being President-Elect Biden’s swearing in ceremony and administration of the oath of office on January 20.

i0m1wk,Megathread: President Trump Suggests Delaying 2020 Presidential Election,"President Trump on Thursday suggested delaying November’s presidential election.

The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20 inauguration.

Any such move would require a change of federal law, meaning it would need to go through Democrats in the House of Representatives in addition to the Republican-controlled Senate. (The Congressional Research Service actually weighed in on this topic in March, specifically noting that a president has no legal authority to change the date of the election.)

The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20 inauguration.

Any such move would require a change of federal law, meaning it would need to go through Democrats in the House of Representatives in addition to the Republican-controlled Senate. (The Congressional Research Service actually weighed in on this topic in March, specifically noting that a president has no legal authority to change the date of the election.)

1dsupsh,"Megathread: US Supreme Court Finds in Trump v. United States That Presidents Have Full Immunity for Constitutional Powers, the Presumption of Immunity for Official Acts, and No Immunity for Unofficial Acts","On Monday, the US Supreme Court sent the case of Trump v. United States back to a lower court in Washington, which per [AP](https://apnews.com/live/supreme-court-trump-presidential-immunity-updates#00000190-6eb5-d1c9-a1d1-7ff720090000) has the effect of ""dimming prospect of a pre-election trial"".  The majority opinion, authored by Chief Justice Roberts, found that:

>Under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of Presidential power entitles a former President to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority. And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. There is no immunity for unofficial acts.

Tonight, starting at 9 p.m. Eastern, Ohio senator J.D. Vance (Republican) and Minnesota governor Tim Walz (Democratic) will participate in a debate hosted by CBS News.  Per [CBS' 'What to Know' page](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vp-debate-2024-what-to-know/), the debate will run for 90 minutes, will not have an audience, and will not feature opening statements.  Also per that page: ""Candidates, who cannot bring pre-written notes or props on stage, will have two minutes to answer a question and two minutes to respond. They will be allowed one minute for rebuttals. At moderators' discretion, candidates may get an additional minute to continue a discussion.""  CBS ""reserves the right"" to turn off a given candidates' microphone, but mics will not be muted by default while a candidate's opponent is speaking.

9v2tdt,"I’m Alex Thompson, a POLITICO reporter focused on 2020. Ask me anything about last night’s midterm election and the 2020 presidential race.","Let’s talk about last night: Democrats won the House and flipped several state legislatures and governorships. Republicans increased their majority in the Senate to 54-46 (if their leads in Arizona and Florida hold, and if they win the Mississippi runoff, which they probably will). 

Democrats had a decent night but, if they’re being honest, it wasn’t the night they were hoping for. High profile candidates like Andrew Gillum, Stacey Abrams, and Beto O’Rourke all appear to have come up short (although Abrams has yet to conceded in Georgia). Democrats also came up short in a few suburban House races they were confident in plus the goverships in Ohio and Iowa. 

Still, the Democrats accomplished their main goal: gaining control of the House. We expect the newly-empowered Democrats to immediately begin wielding their subpoena power and launch investigations into the Trump administration, and for many Democrats start making moves to run for president in 2020. You’ve probably heard about Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders but we could also see Mayor Michael Bloomberg, billionaire-turned-climate activist Tom Steyer, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, Montana Governor Steve Bullock and many, many more.

Ask me anything about last night’s election and the 2020 presidential race.

q1my4,"I didn't plan on getting too involved in the upcoming presidential election, until I read an AP article today about how Santorum is attacking prenatal screenings for birth defects.  Now I'm enraged and I plan on making my voice heard.  Here's my personal story.","First off, here's the link to the story I read:

http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jc5dJQLjmJDkHtUDs8ZRjrB_TZ0A?docId%3D3c78e67d8ae541539eb16695717a6cfc

tldr; Former Senator Santorum wants to eliminate requiring insurers to cover screenings for birth defects because he thinks it encourages women to have abortions.  His opinions are not only narrow-minded, but also dangerous.

Here's my story:

My wife and I were married in September of 2005.  After a few years of marriage, we decided to start trying to have a baby.  After years and years of frustration with no results, we finally conceived in the summer of 2010.  Both of us & our families were overjoyed.  We immediately started baby shopping & picking out names & working on the nursery ... all the things that excited first time parents do.

My wife was also very fastidious with her prenatal care.  She routinely attended all of her doctor's appointments and followed all their instructions to a tee.  Part of that prenatal care included a screening for birth defects.  Neither of us gave it much thought, she went to the lab one day & took the test.

On the night of our 5 year wedding anniversary, we received a call from our OB that the test results came back and some of the findings were ""concerning"".  She wanted us to schedule an ultrasound with a specialist ASAP. 

The day for the ultrasound comes around and instead of heading back to one of the exam rooms like we expected, instead we were taken to an office of a Genetic Counselor who walked us thorough all these different birth defects.  It was like getting broadsided by a bus.  After talking with the counselor, we met with a tech that performed the ultrasound.  

I can remember this next moment like it just happened.  Neither I nor my wife are doctors, so we have no idea what to look for during the ultrasound.  We both just thought it was neat seeing our baby for the first time.  After a while, the doctor walked in and took a quick look at the screens.  Before he said anything, he put a box of tissues in front of my wife ... and my heart immediately sunk.

He let us know, very frankly, that there was definitely a problem with the baby and that in his opinion it was most likely Trisomy 18. Chances for survival to full term were nearly 0%.  He advised that we should do an amniocentesis, so we knew exactly what we were dealing with. I'm not really a crier, but I remember that day weeping for not only the baby that we were losing, but also for the health and safety of my wife.

A few days later the results of the amniocentesis came back and it was determined that the baby had Triploidy.  Basically the baby had 3 copies of each chromosome instead of 2.  There was no chance that the baby would live and my wife would most likely miscarry any day.  We reviewed all of our options.

Option 1 was to wait for nature to take its course and my wife would have to go through all the pain (both physical & emotional) of childbirth.

Option 2 was to do a D&E.  Basically my wife would be put under and an hour later it would be over.

I'm sure that you can guess which route we went with.  But let's get back to the whole purpose of this story ... Former Senator Santorum's idiotic notion that prenatal screenings are somehow bad.  

Had my wife not taken that test, we wouldn't have know that there was a problem and most likely she would have miscarried - not only putting her immediate health at risk, but also jeopardizing our chances of having a baby in the future.

Aside from the physical risks, it also gave us a chance, as a family, to come to acceptance over the situation over time. Having immediate access to counselors and the wonderful staff at Wellspan helped us get through, what had to be, the worst day of our lives.

Former Senator Santorum - You have just motivated me to now get involved.  I had planned on only just voting for Obama and calling it a day.  Now I will do everything in my power to let people know what kind of narrow minded asshole you are.  You are a toxic danger to all American women and I will do my part in seeing that your candidacy is defeated.

You may notice that I kept referring to him as ""Former Senator"".  That's because I'm from PA & we've fired his ass 1x already & we’re going to do it again.

EDIT: Wow, Front Page.  Thank you so much for all your kind words. It means more to me than you'd know.

r5t7ma,"We’re Arizona Republic reporters Jen Fifield, Yvonne Sanchez and Ron Hansen, and we’ve covered the Arizona Senate’s partisan audit of Maricopa County’s 2020 presidential election since it began last November. Ask us anything.","Even before Arizona was called for President Joe Biden, election fraud theorists and Republican leaders, including then-President Donald Trump, began questioning the integrity of the state’s election. A year later, lawsuits and jokes surrounding the review of the 2020 election in Arizona’s biggest county persist.   

Election experts correctly predicted that the audit would take much longer and cost much more than the original estimate. They also raised concerns about the partisanship and lack of transparency of an audit led and funded by election fraud conspiracists and the state Senate Republicans’ efforts to keep secret all documents related to the audit.  

The final report that the Senate released confirmed that Biden won the election by a higher margin than the county’s official results and offered no definitive proof of any election fraud. However, the results of the audit seemingly have changed no one’s minds.    

We’ve spent the past four months digging even deeper into the audit’s origins, and we released a five-part investigative series that includes never-before-reported information about the review of Maricopa County’s 2020 election and its lasting effects.   

We’re Arizona Republic reporters Jen Fifield, Yvonne Wingett Sanchez and Ron Hansen, and we’ve been reporting on the Arizona audit from the very beginning. We’ve observed the counting, read the documents and talked to people on the inside. Ask us anything.

If we didn't get to your questions, we'll** **check back throughout the week to answer as many as possible.

Ask us anything. Even before Arizona was called for President Joe Biden, election fraud theorists and Republican leaders, including then-President Donald Trump, began questioning the integrity of the state’s election. A year later, lawsuits and jokes surrounding the review of the 2020 election in Arizona’s biggest county persist.   

Election experts correctly predicted that the audit would take much longer and cost much more than the original estimate. They also raised concerns about the partisanship and lack of transparency of an audit led and funded by election fraud conspiracists and the state Senate Republicans’ efforts to keep secret all documents related to the audit.  

The final report that the Senate released confirmed that Biden won the election by a higher margin than the county’s official results and offered no definitive proof of any election fraud. However, the results of the audit seemingly have changed no one’s minds.    

We’ve spent the past four months digging even deeper into the audit’s origins, and we released a five-part investigative series that includes never-before-reported information about the review of Maricopa County’s 2020 election and its lasting effects.   

We’re Arizona Republic reporters Jen Fifield, Yvonne Wingett Sanchez and Ron Hansen, and we’ve been reporting on the Arizona audit from the very beginning. We’ve observed the counting, read the documents and talked to people on the inside. Ask us anything.

The candidates' microphones will, under rules negotiated between the Biden and Trump campaigns, be muted in the absence of ""significant crosstalk"".  The [full rules for tonight's debate can be found here on ABC's site](https://abc.com/news/5e38600c-4732-4cd2-a99c-3dedfa81beb0/category/1138628).

Tonight's debate is the only remaining presidential-level debate scheduled for this cycle; the Vice Presidential debate between Minnesota governor Tim Walz and Ohio senator J.D. Vance is scheduled for October 1st.

It is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. Eastern and last for 90 minutes.  The candidates' microphones will, under rules negotiated between the Biden and Trump campaigns, be muted in the absence of ""significant crosstalk"".  The [full rules for tonight's debate can be found here on ABC's site](https://abc.com/news/5e38600c-4732-4cd2-a99c-3dedfa81beb0/category/1138628).  Per [a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/10/nx-s1-5106660/election-poll-harris-trump-debate), ""Seven-in-10 Americans say they are going to watch the first presidential debate between Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump on Tuesday, and 3-in-10 say it will help decide their vote"".

Tonight's debate is the only remaining presidential-level debate scheduled for this cycle; the Vice Presidential debate between Minnesota governor Tim Walz and Ohio senator J.D. Vance is scheduled for October 1st.

t14xi8,Megathread: President Biden Nominates Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court,"In response to Justice Breyer's retirement, President Biden has nominated US Court of Appeals Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson for a seat on the Supreme Court of the United States.

After graduating from Harvard University, Jackson clerked for Justice Breyer and served as vice chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission. She was nominated for district court judgeship by President Obama and was considered as a potential replacement for Justice Scalia. She was elevated to the US Court of Appeals in March of 2021 after receiving confirmation votes from a bipartisan collection of Senators, including Lindsay Graham, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski.

Following the nomination, Jackson will face the Senate Judiciary Committee and undergo vetting and questioning by the 20-person team. The committee will then vote on whether or not to advance her to the Full Senate for a final approval vote. If seated, she will have a lifetime appointment and become the first Black woman to serve on the court, as has been pledged by Biden throughout his campaign and presidency.

nn2e9b,Megathread: GOP Blocks Bipartisan Probe of Deadly Jan. 6 Riot at Capitol,"Senate Republicans on Friday blocked creation of a bipartisan panel to study the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, turning aside the independent investigation in a show of party loyalty to former President Donald Trump and an effort to shift the political focus away from the violent insurrection by his GOP supporters.

The Senate vote was 54-35 — short of the 60 votes needed to take up a House-passed bill that would have formed a 10-member commission evenly split between the two parties. It came a day after emotional appeals from police who fought with the rioters and lawmakers who fled Capitol chambers that day.

Six Republicans (Portman, Sasse, Cassidy, Collins, Murkowski, Romney) voted with Democrats to move forward. Eleven senators missed the rare Friday vote.

The Senate vote was 54-35 — short of the 60 votes needed to take up a House-passed bill that would have formed a 10-member commission evenly split between the two parties. It came a day after emotional appeals from police who fought with the rioters and lawmakers who fled Capitol chambers that day.

Six Republicans (Portman, Sasse, Cassidy, Collins, Murkowski, Romney) voted with Democrats to move forward. Eleven senators missed the rare Friday vote.

cd4qn2,Megathread: Trump Tells Freshman Congresswomen to 'Go Back' to the Countries They Came From,"President Trump on Sunday lashed out at a group of progressive Democrats, saying the female lawmakers should ''go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came'' before criticizing policies in the U.S.

''So interesting to see 'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run,'' Trump said in an early morning string of tweets.

bcgn6w,I'm Senator Mike Gravel and I'm running for President in 2020. Ask Me Anything!,"I'm Former Alaskan Senator Mike Gravel and I've just announced that I am running for President in 2020. Instead of seeking to win the nomination, I'll be attempting to get 65,000 unique donations so that I can qualify for the Democratic debates and put American imperialism on trial. At the debate, I'll present a truly progressive vision of America, forcing establishment Democrats to go on record on things like illegal wars, healthcare, and campaign finance reform. Once I've pushed the conversation to the left at the debates, I'll drop out and endorse the leading progressive.

This is a radically different campaign for president because **we are not trying to win,** or even to contest any primaries. I'm here to change the conversation inside the Democratic party and open up more room on the left.

I will be joined by my Campaign Manager and Chief of Staff, David Oks ([@DavidEOks](https://twitter.com/davideoks)) and Henry Williams ([@humford](https://twitter.com/humford)), respectively. David and Henry are the two New York students responsible for convincing me to run, and for the social media storm that has surrounded our announcement. Feel free to ask us anything about our campaign or about my career fighting for peace!

obnl08,Megathread: Supreme Court Upholds Arizona Voting Restrictions,"The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld voting restrictions in Arizona.
The 6-3 ruling, with the court's conservative justices in the majority, reversed a lower court ruling in deciding that Arizona’s limits on who can return early ballots for another person and refusal to count ballots cast in the wrong precinct are not racially discriminatory.

The kind of selfish arrogance relayed by these posts is uncomfortable to anyone who lives in a minority that is subject to abuse.

or...

>These laws are intended for special circumstances etc.

And this is what makes me want to slap reddit over the head with a bag of moray eels. Laws will be twisted and bent and flat-out broken by those who feel they have the power and need to do so. We see this time and time again with gerrymandering, political espionage, and most recently insider trading. 

Laws should not be judged by their intent, but their potential for abuse and the possible ramifications of their enactment. I don't care if you voted on a bill that was intended to feed thousands of hungry Americans, because in reality that bill probably has about 30 or 40 riders that will allow you to also bomb several small suburban homes in Nebraska (and I love nebraska, and you should too).

The kind of selfish arrogance relayed by these posts is uncomfortable to anyone who lives in a minority that is subject to abuse.

or...

>These laws are intended for special circumstances etc.

And this is what makes me want to slap reddit over the head with a bag of moray eels. Laws will be twisted and bent and flat-out broken by those who feel they have the power and need to do so. We see this time and time again with gerrymandering, political espionage, and most recently insider trading. 

Laws should not be judged by their intent, but their potential for abuse and the possible ramifications of their enactment. I don't care if you voted on a bill that was intended to feed thousands of hungry Americans, because in reality that bill probably has about 30 or 40 riders that will allow you to also bomb several small suburban homes in Nebraska (and I love nebraska, and you should too).

1. Very few people will profess that President Obama is not an American citizen after today.  The percentage of those who believe that particular myth will fall.

2. President Obama's popularity will skyrocket for a short period, and probably settle back down in the low 60s.  If unemployment continues to fall, he will probably stay there through the election.

3. The Republican Party is finished for the short term.  It may well split.  They have spent the last 3 years calling Obama every vile name in the book, and virtually no one is going to want to hear that now, at least in the short term.  They have boxed themselves in by using such extremist language about the President that they cannot now climb back down from it in order to soak up some goodwill.  

4. Palin, Gingrich, Trump, and Bachmann are all finished.

5. Some prominent names floated for the Republican Presidential Nomination will drop out of the race (or never enter it), because under most circumstances none of those currently mentioned can now defeat Obama, unless something terrible happens before the election.

6. Fox ""News"" will try to carry on the fight, but fewer people will be in the mood for its viciousness.  

7. Rep. Paul Ryan's budget is dead.  Obama will now have tremendous leverage in putting together a less insane budget.  

8. President Obama's life is now in real mortal danger.  The powers that be now realize they cannot, under most circumstances, defeat him in 2012 at the ballot box.  I am certain we will see at least one attempt.

9. The mood of the nation will start to improve.  While this does not change certain economic facts (the debt, etc.), a change in mood could have a tremendous impact on the nation.  We really needed a win, and we just got one.  People will start to feel better, at least in the short term.  Again, that doesn't change some things, but we just suffered through a bitter, humiliating decade and this will go a long way to lifting the nation's spirits and hopefully return some rationality to our political debates.  

10. Obama will lead the Democrats to a smashing victory in 2012.  The Democratic Party will continually remind everyone that Obama is the one who killed him, and not Bush.  The Republicans will be unable to attack him with the same amount of rage and vitriol, and therefore will not be able to use fear and hatred to attract votes as they have done since 2001.  

11. The calls to speed up the withdrawal from Afghanistan will grow.  

12. The calls to cut defense spending will grow, as will the movement to tax the rich instead of cut services.  Obama will come out strong in favor of the latter, if not the former.

13. The fact that Obama is now a hero will energize the left in this country after a long sleep.  Democrats now have their Ronald Reagan.

14. Much of press will now move even more into the Obama camp; this means that many will be less willing to tolerate the irrational attacks on the President (and most of the attacks are irrational) because the viewing public won't be in the mood to hear it.  

15. The Republican Party may well now nominate former Governor Tim Pawlenty because he has not been out there saying terrible things about Obama, but is a conservative.  I can't think of anyone else that fits that bill (but I well may).  

16. Conspiracy theories will pop up that this is a fraud, but few people will buy into it.  These will be the ""death certificate-ers.""  If it is a fraud, why release the news at 11:00 on a Sunday night a year and a half before the election?  Why not release it next October?

17. The Republicans have spent an entire decade waving this bloody flag, and President Obama just took it away from them.  He promised to make bin Laden's capture a top priority, and he fulfilled that promise.  Suddenly a lot of other things he supports are going to make sense to more people.  

18. Some or all of these predictions depend upon the notion that there will be no major terrorist attack between now and the 2012 elections, or some other national emergency or tragedy for which President Obama would have to take a share of the blame.  

19. There will always be people who don't like, and always be people who continue their irrational and rather obsessive hatred for him.  But I think that the percentage of those people will fall.  Thus everyone who built there reputation on hating Obama will suffer, because fewer people will be in the mood to hate him with such passion.  No matter what, he will always be ""the guy who got bin Laden.""  

20. Americans love to back a winner.  This has been proven many times over.  Obama is now a winner, and a certain percentage of the population will shift to his side, even if they don't fully understand why.  People like to back winners because it makes them feel like they themselves are winners.  (Think about how passionate people can be about their sports teams.  Why are the Yankees popular?  Because they win.  It certainly isn't because they a bunch of good people.  But they win and so people like them.)

In 1981, 2 months after taking office, President Ronald Reagan's popular support had begun to fall.  The recession didn't seem to be getting better.  Reagan had proposed a rather radical budget that slashed social spending and taxes, and the Democrats who controlled Congress were not interested.  Then, in March, a young man obsessed with Jodi Foster named John Hinkley tried to assassinate Reagan.  

As the oldest person ever elected, it didn't seem likely that he'd survive.  But he did.  And he was back on the job fairly quickly.  His popularity skyrocketed, and the Democrats in Congress caved in and voted for his irrational budget.  Reaganomics was born out of the assassination attempt as much as the minds of willfully ignorant economists.  

The death of Osama bin Laden at the hands of the US military, on the promise of the President, is ten times more important (potentially) than the attempt on Reagan's life.  Why? Because bin Laden gave us a black eye, if you take my meaning.  Not only did he murder our fellow Americans, he showed us to be vulnerable.  This scared the American people very deeply, and we have held bitter resentment and rage against him ever since then, for both reasons.  We can let that anger and rage and bitterness go now that he's dead.  Releasing that tension is incredibly significant to our road ahead.  We can move on from 9/11 now, because the architect has been punished, finally, at long last, after years of disappointment and disaster.  We will feel better because the person who hurt and humiliated us has now paid with his life.

ddi2a,I am a liberal Democrat who attends Tea Party meetings. Just some things I wanted to clarify about Teabaggers. ,"Throwaway account.

I work for a Democrat, who also happens to be a member of Congress. They know I work for him (I make no effort to cover this up, and tell anyone who asks). They are working very hard to get him out of office. I often pull out a video camera and film anything I think might be useful.

There are a lot of misconceptions about the Tea Party that are spread in the media (just like there would be if there were a left wing equivalent of the Tea Party, or just like there was during the anti-war protests). 

The ones I meet with are very aware that they have a have been given a bad reputation by cable news. Virtually none of them will talk about social issues (except abortion), ever. This includes gay rights. Many of them are not racist. But many others don't know the difference between 'Mexican' and 'illegal immigrant'. I'm working on this with them.

On many issues they don't agree with each other. The largest split is between the Ron Paul style libertarians and the pseudo-libertarian neocons... all these two factions agree on is that Democrats suck. The neocons are winning.

They welcome me with open arms, while partisan Republican groups throw me out immediately, and try to call the cops on me, when I attend their meetings.  Tea Partiers are generally friendly, but they live in a media bubble. They NEVER hear a dissenting opinion. To them progressives are evil (in theory). If you expose them to progressive arguments, you will not be able to turn them into progressives.  But you will be able to change their minds on specific issues. I've gotten individuals to agree that radical campaign finance reform is necessary. I've gotten individuals to agree with me on net neutrality. Gay rights. I got one to say that healthcare reform 'probably isn't that bad of a thing'.  But this works both ways. Beware though, they may get you to question your beliefs on certain things (specific fiscal issues). This is not necessarily a bad thing.

Make no mistake, they are still crazy though. 

EDIT: We're all people. Even Tea Partiers. Please remember that.

EDIT 2: Seriously though, all my hippy love talk shouldn't stop you from calling up the best candidate running in your district and volunteering. Seriously, we need you guys to get involved. This is a very important year.

a9bke,How the Radical Left sets back Gay Rights,"Singer Adam Lambert, a fan of black nail polish and sharp bracelets strutted onto the stage of the American Music Awards earlier this month to perform ""For Your Entertainment.""

And entertaining it was not. Aside from the intense french kissing with another male on stage, Lambert grinded a dancer's head directly into his groin and grabbed the crotch of another man. About the only freaky ritual not performed was the passing out of condoms and HIV tests.

Most Americans are decent individuals who don't care how others live their lives. When something provocative like this happens, I don't think the average family worries about heterosexual or homosexual, but rather, what are my children being exposed to? This program was not during normal ""indecency is OK"" hours, and surely people of all ages were watching the program.

The day after this perv-a-thon, instead of condemning this action, many of my gay friends on Facebook became ""fans"" of Lambert. 

This is precisely one of the many reasons why gay activists have had major setbacks throughout 2008 and 2009, such as the ultra-liberal states of Maine and California banning gay marriage. 

In leftist New York, the State Assembly passed a bill allowing for the legalization of gay marriage way back in May. The State Senate is now wavering on the bill due to lack of public support and there is uncertainty on whether the votes are there. In New Jersey, Gov. Jon Corzine, a gay marriage supporter, whose four year tenure included a majority Democratic legislature lost re-election last November to gay marriage opponent Chris Christie. A once expected gay marriage bill vote is now still in limbo. 

Regardless of the approach by which gay activists prefer to take to achieve a means to their personal agenda, everyone has to agree that the current strategy isn't working.

The following are my top five thoughts of what needs to change, should gays desire recognition of their relationships.


A. Civil Unions/Domestic Partnerships
Too many gays are opposing civil unions and domestic partnerships because they don't include the word ""marriage."" This is a very selfish road to take. Does the word 'marriage' mean more than the actual rights and privileges that come with it? 

B. Don't compare gay rights to the civil rights movement.
When I see gays being hosed down in the public square by police, drinking from separate drinking fountains, being called 3/5'ths of a person, or sold into slavery, then I'll say it's like the civil rights movement. Otherwise, it's rubbish and insulting and again hurts the cause. 70%+ of African-American voters in California voted to ban gay marriage, and it doesn't look like the number went down due to this comparison. 

Real oppression is being put to death in Iran by hanging, with Muslim fanatics cheering on the executioners for making love to your partner.

C. Stop sponsoring and start condemning indecent, sexually charged events.
Every year, many gays choose to participate in the Folsom St. Fair and Dore Alley in San Francisco. Common occurrences at these events include dressing in leather with your kids beside you, whipping, epithets and objects directed at religious texts and idols are just the half of it.

This is what most Americans would find repugnant, and because it is a public event, it is what the media will cover. All ""gay rights"" groups and other companies, as well as the city of San Francisco, should condemn such actions in their streets and embrace traditional family values--and at the very least not encourage participation in them.

D. Accusations of homophobia and bigotry
The common, and dangerous assumption many gays make is that every living soul in America who opposes gay marriage is a bigot or a homophobe. How does this kind of name-calling benefit the cause? 

The gay left enjoys giving Democrats a free pass on gay marriage, when their view is the same as other Republicans. Sarah Palin, for employing a view that she believes in traditional marriage, is labeled a religious fanatic and a homophobe. Yet Lord Barack Obama, who went on stage with ""ex-gay"" Donnie McClurkin to get the black vote in South Carolina, and widely considered to be dragging his feet on issues important to gays, is given the star treatment. It is hypocritical and inexplicable to cry homophobia not only where it doesn't exist, but for all this talk about equality, shouldn't equal treatment be provided to everyone?

If you want to believe that not supporting gay marriage automatically makes someone a homophobic bigot, then so be it. This also makes Barack Obama a homophobic bigot. Helpful hint: Calling people a bigot won't win their support.

E. Leadership
Barney Frank. Lady Gaga. Adam Lambert. - Really?
Can anyone name a true ""leader"" working to recognize gay relationships? I certainly can't, but I can name the folks who I think are out front. Let's see, there's Barney Frank, a gay Congressman from Massachusetts who admitted to paying hustler Steve Gobie for sex, and the guy who shilled for Fannie and Freddie. Not exactly a model citizen.

Lady Gaga, who's songs lyrics ""I want to take a ride on your disco stick"" aren't exactly family friendly, and perpetuate the ""gays are perverts"" meme, seems to be another favorite who believes shouting and yelling will get her her way. Obama,, ""ARE YOU LISTENING????""

Adam Lambert, who now appears to be a ""victim"" of homophobia--now has more gay 'fans' and support than ever.

Gay activists would do well to find leader(s) for their cause that are normal, ordinary Americans. Not Hollywood celebrity counter-culture types who encourage stereotypes and have more skeletons in their closet they can count.

---------------------------------------

History has proven that when a different approach is taken to achieving these means, it has worked. Instead of looking to unelected judges in robes to dictate millennia worth of history for the citizens, Vermont and New Hampshire chose to take the right route for changing the law.

How does a law change? Civics 101. Legislatures pass the law, governor's sign/veto it, legislature can override the video with a huge majority. Vermont's legislature overrid a gubernatorial veto and legalized gay marriage, and New Hampshire's Governor signed a bill legalizing it. Guess what? It hasn't yet been overturned by the people. Guess something was done right.

Whereas, in California, four judges decided to create a right that didn't exist in the constitution. Sometimes, what might make people feel good or even what some consider to be ""right,"" isn't really a constitutional protection and should not be treated as such no matter how much we would want said factor to be considered. As a result, California's gays were left more devastated than ever last year.

Elizabeth ([me!](https://twitter.com/ElizabethHira)) is a democracy reform lawyer who worked on the first version of HR1 last Congress, serving as an Elections Counsel in the Committee that led the bill through the House (@HouseAdm_Dems). I’m now a Spitzer Fellow at the Brennan Center, where I’ve been lifting up the case that the For The People Act is America’s [next great civil rights bill](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/people-act-americas-next-great-civil-rights-bill) -- forwarding equity, intersectionally, for so many communities.  It’s my privilege to spread the good word about the bill’s transformative potential to large audiences of organized, mobilized Americans like you! (I will also talk to you about it in the grocery line, I believe in it that strongly.) I’ve been fighting for equity reforms since I was a wee baby lawyer, from supporting reproductive justice with the Center for Reproductive Rights to advancing reforms against sexual harassment as an aide to Senator Kamala Harris. This is also my first AMA, so not a big deal at all to be doing it with THE Larry Lessig (!?!?)  :)

Lessig ([me](https://www.geneseo.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article/public/sites/news/Lessig-ted3-landscape%20view.jpg.jpeg?itok=PMDYMneh)!) has been in the trenches for the last 14 years, writing books ([Republic Lost](https://lessig.org/product/republic-lost-v1)(2011), [One Way Forward](https://lessig.org/product/one-way-forward) (2012), [The US is Lesterland](https://www.amazon.com/dp/149470160X/ref=rdr_ext_tmb), [Republic Lost, v2](https://lessig.org/product/republic-lost-v2) (2015), [America Compromised](https://lessig.org/product/america-compromised) (2018), [They Don't Represent US](https://lessig.org/product/they-don-t-represent-us) (2019)), endless articles and essays, and organizing movements of people to demand democracy, finally. With [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) and (Joe Trippi)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Trippi], I started [Change Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_Congress#:~:text=Founded%20in%202008%20by%20Lawrence,reform%20to%20increase%20congressional%20transparency.) in 2007, that became Rootstrikers in 2010. In 2014, I helped launch the [MayDayPAC](https://mayday.us/). In 2014, we begin a series of marches across New Hampshire (with the [New Hampshire Rebellion](https://www.nhrebellion.org/), including two across the whole state in January!), in the spirit of [Granny D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Haddock) (and in memory of Aaron), demanding campaign finance reform. And after trying mightily to get the issue of  fundamental reform on the Democratic debate state in 2015 (see the [Citizen Equality Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Equality_Act_of_2017))), I started [EqualCitizens.us](https://equalcitizens.us/), which is litigating and organizing for an equal democracy for all.

The For The People Act is in the Senate right now, and could actually become law, but only with your help! It includes voting rights reform, gerrymandering reform, election security measures, transparency requirements, ethics rules for the Supreme Court, Congress, and the President, and, for the first time in American history, a system to enable Congressional candidates to fund their campaigns with small-contributions only. The bill has passed the House (twice), if we can get filibuster reform, there’s a real chance it could pass the Senate and become law. Let’s talk about what it does and why it is so important.

cd4qn2,Megathread: Trump Tells Freshman Congresswomen to 'Go Back' to the Countries They Came From,"President Trump on Sunday lashed out at a group of progressive Democrats, saying the female lawmakers should ''go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came'' before criticizing policies in the U.S.

''So interesting to see 'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run,'' Trump said in an early morning string of tweets.

hta71f,"Megathread: Congressman John Lewis, Civil Rights Icon, Dies at 80","Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), the renowned Civil Rights leader who served as a symbol of the movement throughout his more than three decades in Congress, died Friday at the age of 80.

From the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington to the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama on ""Bloody Sunday,"" Lewis decisively carved a place for himself in the history books as a courageous young activist during the height of the Civil Rights Movement. 

He was elected to Congress in 1986 and served 17 terms representing an Atlanta-area district.

bcgn6w,I'm Senator Mike Gravel and I'm running for President in 2020. Ask Me Anything!,"I'm Former Alaskan Senator Mike Gravel and I've just announced that I am running for President in 2020. Instead of seeking to win the nomination, I'll be attempting to get 65,000 unique donations so that I can qualify for the Democratic debates and put American imperialism on trial. At the debate, I'll present a truly progressive vision of America, forcing establishment Democrats to go on record on things like illegal wars, healthcare, and campaign finance reform. Once I've pushed the conversation to the left at the debates, I'll drop out and endorse the leading progressive.

This is a radically different campaign for president because **we are not trying to win,** or even to contest any primaries. I'm here to change the conversation inside the Democratic party and open up more room on the left.

I will be joined by my Campaign Manager and Chief of Staff, David Oks ([@DavidEOks](https://twitter.com/davideoks)) and Henry Williams ([@humford](https://twitter.com/humford)), respectively. David and Henry are the two New York students responsible for convincing me to run, and for the social media storm that has surrounded our announcement. Feel free to ask us anything about our campaign or about my career fighting for peace!

EDIT: Hey folks, we'll resume the Q&A at 3pm EST - the senator is asleep right now.",4440,1308,0.9646,"I'm Senator Mike Gravel and I'm running for President in 2020. Ask Me Anything! I'm Former Alaskan Senator Mike Gravel and I've just announced that I am running for President in 2020. Instead of seeking to win the nomination, I'll be attempting to get 65,000 unique donations so that I can qualify for the Democratic debates and put American imperialism on trial. At the debate, I'll present a truly progressive vision of America, forcing establishment Democrats to go on record on things like illegal wars, healthcare, and campaign finance reform. Once I've pushed the conversation to the left at the debates, I'll drop out and endorse the leading progressive.

This is a radically different campaign for president because **we are not trying to win,** or even to contest any primaries. I'm here to change the conversation inside the Democratic party and open up more room on the left.

I will be joined by my Campaign Manager and Chief of Staff, David Oks ([@DavidEOks](https://twitter.com/davideoks)) and Henry Williams ([@humford](https://twitter.com/humford)), respectively. David and Henry are the two New York students responsible for convincing me to run, and for the social media storm that has surrounded our announcement. Feel free to ask us anything about our campaign or about my career fighting for peace!

obnl08,Megathread: Supreme Court Upholds Arizona Voting Restrictions,"The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld voting restrictions in Arizona.
The 6-3 ruling, with the court's conservative justices in the majority, reversed a lower court ruling in deciding that Arizona’s limits on who can return early ballots for another person and refusal to count ballots cast in the wrong precinct are not racially discriminatory.

FBI Director James Comey has announced that the Bureau has discovered new emails that they believe pertinent to their previously closed investigation into fmr. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server and her use thereof.

*****

**Text of the memo from Director Comey to Congress**

> In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton’s personal email server. I am writing to supplement my previous testimony.

> In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agree that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether the contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.

> Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete the additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony.

*****

**Statements from Secretary Clinton at a short press conference Friday evening**

> We are 11 days out from perhaps the most important national election of our lifetimes.  Voting is already underway in our country, so the American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately.

>So we don't know the facts, which is why we are calling on the FBI to release all the information that it has.  Even Director Comey noted that this new information may not be significant, so let's get it out.


> We’ve heard these rumors.  We don’t know what to believe. And I'm sure there will be even more rumors. That’s why it’s incumbent on the FBI to tell us what they're talking about.  Your guess is as good as mine and I don't think that’s not good enough.

FBI Director James Comey has announced that the Bureau has discovered new emails that they believe pertinent to their previously closed investigation into fmr. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server and her use thereof.

*****

**Text of the memo from Director Comey to Congress**

> In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton’s personal email server. I am writing to supplement my previous testimony.

> In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agree that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether the contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.

> Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete the additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony.

*****

**Statements from Secretary Clinton at a short press conference Friday evening**

> We are 11 days out from perhaps the most important national election of our lifetimes.  Voting is already underway in our country, so the American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately.

>So we don't know the facts, which is why we are calling on the FBI to release all the information that it has.  Even Director Comey noted that this new information may not be significant, so let's get it out.


> We’ve heard these rumors.  We don’t know what to believe. And I'm sure there will be even more rumors. That’s why it’s incumbent on the FBI to tell us what they're talking about.  Your guess is as good as mine and I don't think that’s not good enough.

Updated results can be found [here](http://www.clarionledger.com/misc/election/electioninit.html)

Some immediate analysis:

-The fact that this amendment couldn't even come close to passing in the most socially conservative state in the country is a huge defeat for any grander aspirations the backers of the amendment might have.  It won't stop them from trying but it's good to see that American citizens aren't so easily swayed to radically restrict women's rights.

I make no apologies if you consider yourself a Republican. I am a registered Independent and have voted Republican at various levels of government, but the current crop of Republicans at the national level are off the reservation. To call them bat shit crazy would be an insult to bat shit.


.


**Things Only a Republican Could Believe:**

* Parents who don't want their children to pray in school are Anti-American zealots -- parents who don't want their children to listen to a speech by the President of the United States telling them to work hard and get good grades are noble patriots.

* Peacefully demonstrating against the country starting an international war is treason -- showing up with automatic weapons to protest healthcare reform is democracy at its finest.

* Any government official with a desk job should have every action scrutinized -- any government official with a badge and a gun should never be questioned or disrespected. At all. Ever.

* Questioning the legitimacy of an election because the ""winner"" was selected by the Supreme Court is sour grapes -- questioning the legitimacy of an election because the winner (by the largest number of votes in American history) is really a Kenyan born Muslim despite all evidence to the contrary is being a vigilant American.

* Lying about a blowjob is an impeachable offense -- lying about a war is no big deal, really.

* Investigating a shady land deal involving the First Lady is a matter of National Identity -- investigating the use of torture at the direction of the Executive Branch is a partisan witch hunt.

* Executing Japanese officers for waterboarding prisoners during WWII shows that we have the moral high-ground on human rights -- waterboarding prisoners of our shows that we have the moral high-ground on human rights.

* Sitting two rows in front of Jane Fonda in a 1970 anti-war rally is an OUTRAGE! Shaking Saddam's hand in 1983...meh, not so much.

* Anyone who questions the president during a time of war is giving aide and comfort to the enemy and should be deported...unless the president in question has a (D) next to their name in which case you should undermine them at every turn even if you have to routinely make shit up to do it.

* Socialism, Marxism, Communism and Fascism are all interchangeable words that mean pretty much the same thing.

* Anyone who abuses drugs should be locked up indefinitely...unless they are a popular Republican radio host in which case they need your prayers as they recover from the illness of addiction.

* Health Insurance companies have your best interests in mind and anyone who thinks otherwise is trying to turn America into the Godless heathen nation of Sweden where EVERYONE in the country dies (eventually).

* Obama is an atheist communist muslim who attended a radical christian church.

* Believing that human activity could impact the global environment is crazy talk -- believing that an invisible man in the sky personally told George Bush to invade Iraq to fulfill Biblical prophecy is logically sound.

* The verdict is still out on evolution -- but Jesus Christ returning in our lifetimes is a pretty much a given.

* The media are unquestionably biased against Republicans -- Talk Radio, The Washington Times, The Weekly Standard, The Wall Street Journal, Rightwing Blogs, Fox News and NewsCorp are not part of the media.

* The government should have no part in regulating multi-national corporations as they make decisions that impact the lives of millions of people -- government should regulate individuals by determining who they can marry, what kind of intercourse they can have, what they can smoke, how to manage their pregnancy and how to proceed with end of life decisions.

* Communicating with hostile nations is a stab in the back to our great nation -- Reagan communicating with the USSR during the Cold War was Political Genius.

* Iran is a mortal threat to our nation and anyone who attempts to talk to them is traitorous scum -- selling weapons to Iran and then funneling the money to start wars in South America is clearly in our National interest.

* George Bush kept the nation safe after 9-11 (NOTE: the Anthrax attacks, the DC Sniper and Hurricane Katrina don't count. Also, the fact that 9-11 happened on his watch despite receiving a security briefing specifically warning of the attack doesn't count either.)

* Social Security, Meidcare, public schooling, public libraries, fire departments, police departments and the US Military are as American as Apple Pie -- universal healthcare is ZOMGDEATHPANELSOCIALISM!!

* George W Bush is a regular 'ole Texas rancher just like you and me despite the fact that he was born in Connecticut, attended two Ivy League schools, bought the Crawford ranch just before running for president, sold it immediate after leaving office and is terrified of horses.

* The two guys at the center of the Watergate and Iran-Contra scandals are trustworthy voices in discussions of current national policy and should be taken at face-value.",1304,853,-0.9974,"Things Only a Republican Could Believe So, y'all remember that email that went around years ago called ""Things Only a Republican Could Believe""?

nyhcd,"Cop orders a man to stop singing in public on New Years Eve, then threatens to arrest me for asking why.","Tonight on the J train, as we passed over the Williamsburg bridge, one of my fellow passengers was jovially singing his rendition of ""New York, New York"", and a police officer told him to ""take his singing outside the train."" The guy wasn't panhandling, just festively singing on New Year's Eve. A few of us said to the cop, ""We didn't mind his singing"". When I asked ""Why don't you let the man sing?"", the cop threatened to arrest me. I'm not kidding. The cop and I went back and forth, ""discussing"" whether or not it was the man's right to sing. Then he told me to ""mind my own business"" and threatened to arrest me if I ""kept talking"". Well, then I was really shocked, and I asserted my right to free speech. The cop just kept threatening me, growing evermore hostile, and the singer asked me to please stop talking, because he ""didn't want to see me end up in some YouTube video being dragged off a train and arrested."" Frankly, I didn't want that either. Feeling very humiliated, I shut my mouth.

When I finally got off the train (the officer was getting off at the same stop), I turned to everyone and said ""Goodnight and Happy New Years. I want everyone to think about what just happened between me and the cop and the guy who was singing. He had no right to threaten me with arrest, and no right to tell him to stop singing in the first place.""

Then I got off the train. On the platform, I said to the cop, ""I want you to think about it too."" He just glared at me and replied, ""Why don't you think about it?"" I almost laughed, but instead I said, ""I have been, and you had no right to threaten me."" Still glaring, he just said, ""Yeah? Well, you just keep thinking about it."" I replied ""I will"".

And that was true. I am still thinking about it.

Wanna know what I think? I think that episode was yet another (albeit small) example, in a whole slew that I've personally witnessed and heard about in the past several years, of police in this country overstepping their boundaries, and setting scary precedents of civil rights infringements, and not being penalized for it. I have no idea what that cop was thinking, and I sincerely hope he now realizes his absurd error, but for a cop, his attitude in that moment was, unfortunately, all too familiar. And I'm sure I don't need to mention that this trend of disregarding civil liberties goes all the way up through congress and right to the president, who just signed a bill that allows US citizens to be indefinitely detained without trial (possibly in Gitmo or other overseas prisons).

Based on that, and other aberrations of justice (chronicled right here on r/politics) I would like to assert that the United States is in a downward spiral of civil rights curtailment, coupled with curtailed democratic processes, which would allow us, the citizens, to reverse this very spiral. This began with the patriot act, and today we have a frightening trend of police brutality and militarization, not to mention Citizen's United, NDAA, and SOPA/PIPA.

Because of the ever-worsening characteristic of a spiral, there is no way to escape its inevitable conclusion (which could be quite scary), without stepping outside its boundaries. This downward spiral of ours, by its very nature, continues to narrow our legal avenues for change. So the more time passes, the more laws and precedents restricting our rights will occur, and the less we will be able to legally change course. Thus, in order to save our democracy, we have no choice but to circumvent laws designed to lock in fascistic policies, and the elected officials who legislate them.

This may mean we need to hit the streets big time, and refuse to go home when we're told. It may mean we need to strike. It may mean blocking ports. It may mean a bunch of us need to get arrested. It may mean we need to continually ratchet up literally any kind of pressure that threatens the standing of those in power, no matter how radical such tactics would seem in a ""free society"". It may mean all these things and more. These are the kinds of thoughts Thomas Jefferson had when he wrote the Declaration of Independence. He knew it was time for a fight.

I declare 2012 the year when moral integrity equals getting involved in grassroots political activism, and (pardon the cliche) thinking outside the box. 2011 gave us the right ideas with the Arab Spring, and now Los Indignados, Occupy Wall Street, Russia's White Revolution movement, and recent uprisings in China. We need to take all those examples and run with them.

It's never been conscionable to be ignorant to what's happening, but now it's unconscionable not to do something about it (besides voting). Get involved with the Occupy movement, or a CopWatch program, or be creative and start something new, but get ready to start pushing back and stepping outside legal lines when they are unjust. We simply must have our freedoms.

ddi2a,I am a liberal Democrat who attends Tea Party meetings. Just some things I wanted to clarify about Teabaggers. ,"Throwaway account.

I work for a Democrat, who also happens to be a member of Congress. They know I work for him (I make no effort to cover this up, and tell anyone who asks). They are working very hard to get him out of office. I often pull out a video camera and film anything I think might be useful.

There are a lot of misconceptions about the Tea Party that are spread in the media (just like there would be if there were a left wing equivalent of the Tea Party, or just like there was during the anti-war protests). 

The ones I meet with are very aware that they have a have been given a bad reputation by cable news. Virtually none of them will talk about social issues (except abortion), ever. This includes gay rights. Many of them are not racist. But many others don't know the difference between 'Mexican' and 'illegal immigrant'. I'm working on this with them.

On many issues they don't agree with each other. The largest split is between the Ron Paul style libertarians and the pseudo-libertarian neocons... all these two factions agree on is that Democrats suck. The neocons are winning.

They welcome me with open arms, while partisan Republican groups throw me out immediately, and try to call the cops on me, when I attend their meetings.  Tea Partiers are generally friendly, but they live in a media bubble. They NEVER hear a dissenting opinion. To them progressives are evil (in theory). If you expose them to progressive arguments, you will not be able to turn them into progressives.  But you will be able to change their minds on specific issues. I've gotten individuals to agree that radical campaign finance reform is necessary. I've gotten individuals to agree with me on net neutrality. Gay rights. I got one to say that healthcare reform 'probably isn't that bad of a thing'.  But this works both ways. Beware though, they may get you to question your beliefs on certain things (specific fiscal issues). This is not necessarily a bad thing.

Make no mistake, they are still crazy though.

And entertaining it was not. Aside from the intense french kissing with another male on stage, Lambert grinded a dancer's head directly into his groin and grabbed the crotch of another man. About the only freaky ritual not performed was the passing out of condoms and HIV tests.

Most Americans are decent individuals who don't care how others live their lives. When something provocative like this happens, I don't think the average family worries about heterosexual or homosexual, but rather, what are my children being exposed to? This program was not during normal ""indecency is OK"" hours, and surely people of all ages were watching the program.

The day after this perv-a-thon, instead of condemning this action, many of my gay friends on Facebook became ""fans"" of Lambert. 

This is precisely one of the many reasons why gay activists have had major setbacks throughout 2008 and 2009, such as the ultra-liberal states of Maine and California banning gay marriage. 

In leftist New York, the State Assembly passed a bill allowing for the legalization of gay marriage way back in May. The State Senate is now wavering on the bill due to lack of public support and there is uncertainty on whether the votes are there. In New Jersey, Gov. Jon Corzine, a gay marriage supporter, whose four year tenure included a majority Democratic legislature lost re-election last November to gay marriage opponent Chris Christie. A once expected gay marriage bill vote is now still in limbo. 

Regardless of the approach by which gay activists prefer to take to achieve a means to their personal agenda, everyone has to agree that the current strategy isn't working.

The following are my top five thoughts of what needs to change, should gays desire recognition of their relationships.


A. Civil Unions/Domestic Partnerships
Too many gays are opposing civil unions and domestic partnerships because they don't include the word ""marriage."" This is a very selfish road to take. Does the word 'marriage' mean more than the actual rights and privileges that come with it? 

B. Don't compare gay rights to the civil rights movement.
When I see gays being hosed down in the public square by police, drinking from separate drinking fountains, being called 3/5'ths of a person, or sold into slavery, then I'll say it's like the civil rights movement. Otherwise, it's rubbish and insulting and again hurts the cause. 70%+ of African-American voters in California voted to ban gay marriage, and it doesn't look like the number went down due to this comparison. 

Real oppression is being put to death in Iran by hanging, with Muslim fanatics cheering on the executioners for making love to your partner.

C. Stop sponsoring and start condemning indecent, sexually charged events.
Every year, many gays choose to participate in the Folsom St. Fair and Dore Alley in San Francisco. Common occurrences at these events include dressing in leather with your kids beside you, whipping, epithets and objects directed at religious texts and idols are just the half of it.

This is what most Americans would find repugnant, and because it is a public event, it is what the media will cover. All ""gay rights"" groups and other companies, as well as the city of San Francisco, should condemn such actions in their streets and embrace traditional family values--and at the very least not encourage participation in them.

D. Accusations of homophobia and bigotry
The common, and dangerous assumption many gays make is that every living soul in America who opposes gay marriage is a bigot or a homophobe. How does this kind of name-calling benefit the cause? 

The gay left enjoys giving Democrats a free pass on gay marriage, when their view is the same as other Republicans. Sarah Palin, for employing a view that she believes in traditional marriage, is labeled a religious fanatic and a homophobe. Yet Lord Barack Obama, who went on stage with ""ex-gay"" Donnie McClurkin to get the black vote in South Carolina, and widely considered to be dragging his feet on issues important to gays, is given the star treatment. It is hypocritical and inexplicable to cry homophobia not only where it doesn't exist, but for all this talk about equality, shouldn't equal treatment be provided to everyone?

If you want to believe that not supporting gay marriage automatically makes someone a homophobic bigot, then so be it. This also makes Barack Obama a homophobic bigot. Helpful hint: Calling people a bigot won't win their support.

E. Leadership
Barney Frank. Lady Gaga. Adam Lambert. - Really?
Can anyone name a true ""leader"" working to recognize gay relationships? I certainly can't, but I can name the folks who I think are out front. Let's see, there's Barney Frank, a gay Congressman from Massachusetts who admitted to paying hustler Steve Gobie for sex, and the guy who shilled for Fannie and Freddie. Not exactly a model citizen.

Lady Gaga, who's songs lyrics ""I want to take a ride on your disco stick"" aren't exactly family friendly, and perpetuate the ""gays are perverts"" meme, seems to be another favorite who believes shouting and yelling will get her her way. Obama,, ""ARE YOU LISTENING????""

Adam Lambert, who now appears to be a ""victim"" of homophobia--now has more gay 'fans' and support than ever.

Gay activists would do well to find leader(s) for their cause that are normal, ordinary Americans. Not Hollywood celebrity counter-culture types who encourage stereotypes and have more skeletons in their closet they can count.

---------------------------------------

History has proven that when a different approach is taken to achieving these means, it has worked. Instead of looking to unelected judges in robes to dictate millennia worth of history for the citizens, Vermont and New Hampshire chose to take the right route for changing the law.

How does a law change? Civics 101. Legislatures pass the law, governor's sign/veto it, legislature can override the video with a huge majority. Vermont's legislature overrid a gubernatorial veto and legalized gay marriage, and New Hampshire's Governor signed a bill legalizing it. Guess what? It hasn't yet been overturned by the people. Guess something was done right.

Whereas, in California, four judges decided to create a right that didn't exist in the constitution. Sometimes, what might make people feel good or even what some consider to be ""right,"" isn't really a constitutional protection and should not be treated as such no matter how much we would want said factor to be considered. As a result, California's gays were left more devastated than ever last year.

Sometimes it takes learning the cold hard truth. Whether the radical left chooses to embrace it or continue on this destructive path, is of course entirely up to them.",0,15,0.7328,"How the Radical Left sets back Gay Rights Singer Adam Lambert, a fan of black nail polish and sharp bracelets strutted onto the stage of the American Music Awards earlier this month to perform ""For Your Entertainment.""

Lady Gaga, who's songs lyrics ""I want to take a ride on your disco stick"" aren't exactly family friendly, and perpetuate the ""gays are perverts"" meme, seems to be another favorite who believes shouting and yelling will get her her way. Obama,, ""ARE YOU LISTENING????""

Adam Lambert, who now appears to be a ""victim"" of homophobia--now has more gay 'fans' and support than ever.

Gay activists would do well to find leader(s) for their cause that are normal, ordinary Americans. Not Hollywood celebrity counter-culture types who encourage stereotypes and have more skeletons in their closet they can count.

---------------------------------------

History has proven that when a different approach is taken to achieving these means, it has worked. Instead of looking to unelected judges in robes to dictate millennia worth of history for the citizens, Vermont and New Hampshire chose to take the right route for changing the law.

How does a law change? Civics 101. Legislatures pass the law, governor's sign/veto it, legislature can override the video with a huge majority. Vermont's legislature overrid a gubernatorial veto and legalized gay marriage, and New Hampshire's Governor signed a bill legalizing it. Guess what? It hasn't yet been overturned by the people. Guess something was done right.

Whereas, in California, four judges decided to create a right that didn't exist in the constitution. Sometimes, what might make people feel good or even what some consider to be ""right,"" isn't really a constitutional protection and should not be treated as such no matter how much we would want said factor to be considered. As a result, California's gays were left more devastated than ever last year.

Sometimes it takes learning the cold hard truth.

Living in the US is horrible; not fighting for your life everyday with an AK horrible but mentality and financially horrible. The people in charge (that refuse to leave) still have the mindset that simply putting your nose to the grindstone will yield the same benefits it did 60 years ago. What made America great was the middle class, and that is now gone. It simply doesn't exist (at least for the moment). The days of getting even a quarter decent job and being able to eat anything but cardboard for the next 5 years doesn't depend on your work ethic whatsoever. Everyone focuses on minimum wage then vs now and that's not really a great reference point. The major issue with it is that during that time-frame, people were making significantly more than minimum wage. Back in 1961 minimum wage was introduced at $1.15 and upped to $1.25 in 1964. One of the most common jobs was factory worker among salons, delivery, teaching, and nursing but for this example we are sticking to factory workers. I have looked through a few of their documents according to files saved at [libraryguides.missouri.edu/pricesandwages/1960-1969](https://libraryguides.missouri.edu/pricesandwages/1960-1969), and the lowest paid positions that I could find were very few at $2.09/hr with a high majority being over $3.00/hr (a lot even over $4.50 an hour). Now with minimum wage at the time being only $1.25 a very, VERY high majority of people were making 2.5x minimum wage (or more) which would equal to more than $25/hr today by working a basic labor factory position with minimal education required straight out of high school. So we have an entry level workforce, starting half a decade later, from a point of massive debt, in a system built by the people who grew up in one of the [biggest eras of growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_economic_expansions_in_the_United_States) the US has ever seen that live in a fantasy world where nothing has changed except the work ethic of the younger generations; the same people who should have retired 20+ years ago telling everyone they had it just as hard if not harder and to just keep at it. In what universe does 3 times the pay with less education, living with your parents (or ""the family home"") until after you are married (potentially with children) and not getting flak for it, being able to afford having children without government assistance equal harder?

Then there is the medial catastrophe (and I'm not even talking about big Pharma). Put simply US citizens are dying because we cannot afford to go to the doctor. What the people who say ""I don't want to pay for *THEM""* don't realize is that they already are paying for ""*THEM*""; they are just paying 1 or more CEOs to send them the bill on top of it.

The findings from this data is that the sweet spot for re-election appears to be the late 40s at minimum. George W. Bush and Barack Obama both had split approval ratings and had tighter elections because of that. It was however just high enough to actually get re-elected. Once you get into the early 40s Presidents like Gerald Ford and Donald Trump still have competitive elections, but ultimately lose. The 30s is where electoral landslides happen like Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush. Both of them sought re-election and got clobbered. The flip side is that an approval rating of 50s and above is a strong sign for a successful re-election.

r8jp4m,US polarization is reflected in congressional elections. An overview.,"I was going over the swings between political parties in the House and Senate over the post-war period and the numbers I found really show the depth of polarization of politics in the United States. I'll start with a premise. 

Voters vote in a different political party when their material lives are inadequate. That's especially true in congressional elections where unless the circumstance is serious the average person won't pay too much attention. 

Let's go over some statistics.

1932-1946 (Democratic Dominance)

Many factors came into play in the success of the Democratic Party at this time including Social Security, Medicare, etc. The victory of the Second World War brought the US unbelievable political power and wealth. They were the victors of allied forces against nations trampled to dust. They had to fill that power vacuum. The response to the Great Depression, a Second World War and relative peace afterwards gave the US an unprecedented ability to support a middle class.

1946-1948 & 1952-1954 (Republican Failures to Provide an Alternative)

There is a truism in politics that if the average person had enough money for bread, then political stability is possible. The old saying ""It's the economy stupid"". Republicans had two opportunities to provide an alternative during this time and they failed. From obstruction against Truman to the McCarthy hearings voters were more comfortable with the Democratic Party in charge. They could afford bread. 

1954-1980 (Political Contentment)

Yes it is true that the president changed during this time, but the congress didn't. Democrats controlled both houses of congress and there wasn't any mass scale opposition to them. There was the civil rights movement, women's rights, etc. The thing still stands though that as long as the economy is stable and people can pay the bills for the most part, politics stays steady. 

1980-Present (Growing Polarization)

I'll leave the numbers at the bottom, but it's just staggering. As the years go on, the length of time that a congress stays the same grows shorter. What does that mean? It means that people are demanding political change as every past congress fails. What makes this situation truly counterproductive is that while the voters demand more action from congress a polarized congress becomes less able to govern. Bipartisanship might sound nice and all, but real effective government comes from stable, long term governments. That usually involves one party at the helm. A caveat is that this analysis is only relevant to democracies. Dictatorships can have one party rule and be unstable.

In Conclusion: This polarization however is the norm in American History

This may sound offensive to some people, but the US is a rather unstable country. The lead up to the Civil War, the Gilded Age and what we have now all had this aggressive back and forth between factions. The only times that the US was really politically stable was the early Democratic-Republican governments and the Deal New Era. Everything else is chaos.",2,0,0.893,"US polarization is reflected in congressional elections. An overview. I was going over the swings between political parties in the House and Senate over the post-war period and the numbers I found really show the depth of polarization of politics in the United States. I'll start with a premise. 

Voters vote in a different political party when their material lives are inadequate. That's especially true in congressional elections where unless the circumstance is serious the average person won't pay too much attention. 

Let's go over some statistics.

1932-1946 (Democratic Dominance)

Many factors came into play in the success of the Democratic Party at this time including Social Security, Medicare, etc. The victory of the Second World War brought the US unbelievable political power and wealth. They were the victors of allied forces against nations trampled to dust. They had to fill that power vacuum. The response to the Great Depression, a Second World War and relative peace afterwards gave the US an unprecedented ability to support a middle class.

I’m from the UK and we hear a lot about the USA’s political landscape and I try to some extent to keep up with the current affairs in the US. And I just don’t understand how these two men are in any way deemed fit to lead your country at all. 

I will probably have a lot of agreement when I say that Trump is just Trump. He’s unfit to lead anyway. But particularly recently, the guy is actually a convicted felon charged on 34 counts. How is a convicted felon to be responsible for one of the largest nuclear arsenals of the world and a tense geopolitical climate in terms of Russia V. Ukraine and Israel V Palestine as huge examples? How can a convicted felon run for the ruler of the world? Someone who should be shunned from society playing for the highest role in society? 

This is where I think I’ll find my disagreement (especially being on Reddit). Biden. I swear to god this man is so geriatric now it’s getting insane. People on social media platforms openly mock him now but if we look at that seriously, he’s the current president of the United States and the potential future President of the United States for another term. Would Biden even live long enough for another term? Seriously? It is painfully obvious now that he is on a crazy cognitive decline that renders him incapable of even finishing a sentence. One key example was the presidential debate in which he had buckets of time to prepare for the questions, all he had to do was effectively remember his lines. There was no audience to throw him off the ball. But he still stumbled his way through and at one point mentioned how he’s ’beaten Medicare’ which Trump capitalised on.

The findings from this data is that the sweet spot for re-election appears to be the late 40s at minimum. George W. Bush and Barack Obama both had split approval ratings and had tighter elections because of that. It was however just high enough to actually get re-elected. Once you get into the early 40s Presidents like Gerald Ford and Donald Trump still have competitive elections, but ultimately lose. The 30s is where electoral landslides happen like Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush. Both of them sought re-election and got clobbered. The flip side is that an approval rating of 50s and above is a strong sign for a successful re-election. Joe Biden's current approval rating is 42.2% on average and in my opinion based on the facts he would lose re-election if the election was held today. It would be a tight race, but he would lose.

6x1zsm,[RFC] Presidential Election process proposal,"As a thought experiment, what do you all think about this process of election:

* The electoral college shall elect as President the candidate who receives the Majority of Electoral votes.
* Should no candidate receive a Majority, then all candidates receiving the fewest votes shall be eliminated such that adding the total of the eliminated votes to the first remaining candidate produces a Majority.
* Should no candidate receive a Majority, a new Election date shall be set by Congress to vote on these remaining candidates.

Potentially eliminate the EC and default to a direct vote, as a variation.  Also, potentially use the direct vote counting as a State mechanism for local elections, although this is a State matter.

I believe the above mechanism essentially avoids eliminating any candidate who *can* win, as even a candidate with 1.01% of the votes who is ahead of 49 other 1%-vote candidates would remain and, if receiving all of the votes for those eliminated candidates, would win 50.01% of the votes and would thus defeat *any other candidate*.  No eliminated candidate would, if receiving the votes of all eliminated candidates, breach the 50% mark.

There's a bug here where States have no immediately-obvious way to grind down their candidate list by repeated voting, thus a State can't refuse to cast an EC vote until it has a clear Majority popular vote in that state, because they can't eliminate and re-poll.  That's fixable either by letting States repeat the election each day for a week (strain on the voters) or by just ejecting the EC and counting the popular vote only.

Dropping the EC and giving the popular vote would probably produce the most majority-favored result.

The States can cut back their candidate lists on the way to the Presidential election by declaring voting on candidate ballot access for the Presidential election as a single Statewide election, not a Federal election, and restricting campaign spending and donations to $0 at the State level.  Thus the FEC allows you to have a Campaign Committee for the State-level election and take donations, *but* the state bars such donations to campaigns seeking ballot access votes for Presidential elections.  Your campaign for this is your Presidential campaign.

Implementing the actual Presidential election changes requires replacing the 12th amendment, which requires ratification by 38 states at this time.  The Compact is the only limited way to evade the Constitutional setting.  I wonder if we should pass a Federal law echoing the 12th Amendment, and then propose that the States pass a broad Constitutional Amendment to allow Congress limited power to set the method by which the States may elect a new President.  That may be entirely too much Congressional power.

Alternatively, perhaps we could implement this by Mock Election, passing a law allowing Congress to declare a method to test the results of a new voting system.  The results of such would demonstrate to the people if they prefer this system and what the results would be.  Even if the results are not to their liking, they might perceive a system as more-fair and so prefer it regardless of the results.",5,0,-0.761,"[RFC] Presidential Election process proposal As a thought experiment, what do you all think about this process of election:

Residents express fear after sheriff says ‘write down all the addresses’ of Harris supporters
Ben Wolford·September 16, 2024·4 min read
Portage County Sheriff Bruce Zuchowski seemed to encourage his friends and supporters to write down the addresses of people with Democratic yard signs, sparking accusations of voter intimidation.

In identical posts to his personal and public Facebook accounts on Sept. 13, Zuchowski wrote what he claims to tell people who ask him what will happen if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the presidential election. Using dehumanizing language, he says he tells them to record the addresses of people with Harris yard signs in order to house immigrants with them.

“When people ask me…What’s gonna happen if the Flip – Flopping, Laughing Hyena Wins?? I say…write down all the addresses of the people who had her signs in their yards! Sooo…when the Illegal human “Locust” (which she supports!) Need places to live…We’ll already have the addresses of the their New families…who supported their arrival!” the posts stated, along with accompanying pictures of a television tuned to Fox News. 


In the comments under the post on his personal Facebook page, one supporter replied with the name and street of someone with a Harris sign. “I’ll add that name to the list,” another replied. Someone else commented, “Making a list and checking it twice.”

As of Sept. 15, that post had hundreds of reactions and over 100 shares.

Zuchowski faces a Democratic challenger to his re-election bid in November. He did not reply to questions emailed to him on Sept. 14.

The reaction from residents and Portage County officials was intense over the weekend, with people saying they have filed complaints to state and federal agencies, members of Congress and the ACLU. Others are reconsidering putting political signs in their yards, they said. 

The most high-profile denunciation came on Sept. 15, when Portage County Commissioner Tony Badalamenti criticized the sheriff’s post and announced his resignation from the county’s Republican Central Committee. 

“This is not the leadership I want to be part of,” he said in a video posted to Facebook.

Badalamenti had previously clashed with Zuchowski over the sheriff’s requests for larger and larger budget allocations. Badalamenti had previously supported additional funding but later said the county could no longer afford to meet Zuchowski’s requests. 

This refusal helped precipitate a rift in the Portage County Republican Party that led Zuchowski to endorse primary challengers for Badalamenti’s and Commissioner Sabrina Christian-Bennett’s commission seats. Badalamenti lost his primary race to the Zuchowski-backed candidate.

Badalamenti could not be reached for comment, but in the video he seemed to suggest the sheriff’s Facebook post was the last straw.

“[Zuchowski] posted that we should all copy down the addresses of the people that display political signs which are different from our beliefs,” Badalamenti said. “It scares people. It’s called bullying, from the highest law enforcement official in Portage County.”

Portage County residents who contacted The Portager said they were surprised and fearful. 

“I have a sign in my yard. Our sheriff is asking MAGA to write down our addresses. This is not normal and it is scary,” one person said.

Another expressed concern for her parents: “My parents are elderly and have been very politically active Democrats. I am afraid for them now. I don’t want to scare them or suggest they take down their signs, but I am sick to my stomach with worry.”

Others drew parallels between Zuchowski’s reference to people as “locusts” and racist rhetoric that took place during genocides in Germany and Rwanda.

“The Portage County NAACP was very disappointed to see the divisive post from our elected sheriff,” the organization said in a statement. “We believe that law enforcement and elected officials both have a duty to ensure public safety for all citizens. Encouraging people to keep addresses, presumably so they can later be targeted, is counter to bringing all of us together to better our community. We encourage all citizens to vote their values in November.”

Portage County Democratic Party Chair Denise Smith also encouraged voters to respond to the sheriff’s comments at the polls.

“Any elected official is free to put whatever they want on their personal Facebook page,” she said. “Anything that someone believes is intimidation, the way to counter that is to vote against that in November, and the 109,000 registered voters should fire any elected official that tries to intimidate them.”

Smith said the Portage County Democrats have distributed around 750 Harris yard signs and that residents had been calling her on Saturday. Several told her they were reporting the sheriff’s comments to the attorney general, she said.

It’s unclear whether the post crosses any legal lines. Portage County Prosecutor Vic Vigluicci could not be reached for comment. Smith, a lawyer, declined to offer a legal analysis but said, “I would be intimidated if he said it to me.”

Jon Barber, the Democratic candidate for sheriff, said the episode illustrates the difference between the two men. He said he found the racist language “appalling” and that, in any case, undocumented migration is not a major issue in Portage County.

“I think we can agree that people who are fleeing their home countries and are willing to come across a treacherous plain and unbearable conditions are doing it to seek a better life for their children,” he said. “The sheriff and the former president think they’re all criminals. And I have a hard time seeing that.”

He said he has talked to residents over the weekend who were concerned about putting out signs.

“He ordered his supporters to write down addresses and make a list so that they can pass those on to potential criminals,” Barber said. “I certainly feel that this is voter intimidation.”

“I encourage everybody to ensure you’re registered to vote and that your registration is good,” Barber said.

“The Portage County NAACP was very disappointed to see the divisive post from our elected sheriff,” the organization said in a statement. “We believe that law enforcement and elected officials both have a duty to ensure public safety for all citizens. Encouraging people to keep addresses, presumably so they can later be targeted, is counter to bringing all of us together to better our community. We encourage all citizens to vote their values in November.”

Portage County Democratic Party Chair Denise Smith also encouraged voters to respond to the sheriff’s comments at the polls.

“Any elected official is free to put whatever they want on their personal Facebook page,” she said. “Anything that someone believes is intimidation, the way to counter that is to vote against that in November, and the 109,000 registered voters should fire any elected official that tries to intimidate them.”

Smith said the Portage County Democrats have distributed around 750 Harris yard signs and that residents had been calling her on Saturday. Several told her they were reporting the sheriff’s comments to the attorney general, she said.

It’s unclear whether the post crosses any legal lines. Portage County Prosecutor Vic Vigluicci could not be reached for comment. Smith, a lawyer, declined to offer a legal analysis but said, “I would be intimidated if he said it to me.”

Jon Barber, the Democratic candidate for sheriff, said the episode illustrates the difference between the two men. He said he found the racist language “appalling” and that, in any case, undocumented migration is not a major issue in Portage County.

“I think we can agree that people who are fleeing their home countries and are willing to come across a treacherous plain and unbearable conditions are doing it to seek a better life for their children,” he said. “The sheriff and the former president think they’re all criminals. And I have a hard time seeing that.”

He said he has talked to residents over the weekend who were concerned about putting out signs.

“He ordered his supporters to write down addresses and make a list so that they can pass those on to potential criminals,” Barber said. “I certainly feel that this is voter intimidation.”

“I encourage everybody to ensure you’re registered to vote and that your registration is good,” Barber said.

1c4zrsd,How the Electoral College Became Winner-Take-All - FairVote,"The election of 1824 is most famous for the “corrupt bargain,” a deal in the House of Representatives that gave John Quincy Adams the presidency despite his winning fewer popular and electoral votes than Andrew Jackson. But 1824 was also significant for another reason: it was the first election in which the majority of states used a statewide winner-take-all voting method for choosing their presidential electors.

It is a system that now seems like a fundamental part of the American democracy. Presidential candidates compete to win states, which is how they get votes in the Electoral College. The U.S. Constitution does not mandate that system, however. Instead, it is left up to the states to determine how they select their representatives in the Electoral College. For the first 13 presidential elections, spanning the first four decades of the history of the United States, states experimented with many different electoral systems.

**TLDR The shift to statewide winner-take-all was not done for idealistic reasons. Rather, it was the product of partisan pragmatism, as state leaders wanted to maximize support for their preferred candidate. Once some states made this calculation, others had to follow, to avoid hurting their side. James Madison’s 1823 letter to George Hay, described in my earlier post , explains that few of the constitutional framers anticipated electors being chosen based on winner-take-all rules.**

yx1rdz,The Trump Train is on its last legs. Time for the finale. 2024.,"What a journey and it's almost over. Granted, it's been a thrilling and terrifying seven and half years and there is still two more to go. But we're finally at the end, like a television show that stayed far beyond its peak. Trump has officially jumped the shark and has become boring and a generally accepted loser.

So where did it all go wrong? There is an old saying: How can I miss you if you don't go away. I would like to call these next three parts: the three stages of failure.

2018 Midterms

This was the easiest one for Trump. Most presidents lose seats in the midterms. The House was lost by many seats; however, they picked up seats in the senate from a favorable map that ousted Democrats in more conservative states. At this point there was plenty of rationalizations around keeping Trump in the Republican Party. Most presidents do badly in the midterms. Whatever.

2020 Presidential Election

This is where things got complicated. Trump lost the presidency, but Republicans did well down ballot. The January 6th riots under normal circumstances, would have been enough for the GOP to rid themselves of Trump. The problem is that there were enough mixed messages from voters and a strong base in the GOP that Trump survived a second impeachment. He was hurt, but not out.

2022 Midterms

Three strikes you're out to use the baseball analogy. Trump's obsession with the 2020 election loss spurred election denialism around the country for two years. It met a crashing halt in November. The vast majority of Trump's backed candidates lost in crucial swing races. The GOP lost the Senate and barely gained the House. Now he's a dead man walking.

2024 Presidential Election

Three outcomes can happen. The first and most unlikely is that he wins the nomination and the presidency. It's possible, but something truly crazy would have to happen. The other two options are almost tied for likelihood. He loses the primary to someone like DeSantis or he loses to Biden in the general. Part of politics is knowing when to bow out of a fight you have little chance in. Trump is narcissistic enough to pull forward.

173c3o8,AI Political Instincts Test: Why is Hamas labeled a terrorist organization for its recent attack while the Republican Party is not labeled a terrorist organization for its January 6 attack?,"Whether Hamas and the Republican Party should be condemned as terrorist organizations for their attacks on Israel and the United States, respectively, is a complex question with no easy answer.

**Hamas** is a Palestinian Sunni-Islamist fundamentalist military organization based in the Gaza Strip. It has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Canada, the European Union, Israel, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Hamas's stated goal is to establish an independent Islamic state in Palestine, replacing the State of Israel.

**The Republican Party** is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States. It is generally considered to be center-right on the political spectrum. The Republican Party's platform is based on American conservatism, and it supports free-market capitalism, limited government, individual liberty, a strong national defense, and traditional values.

**On January 6, 2021**, a mob of Donald Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol Building in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The attack was widely condemned as an act of insurrection and domestic terrorism.

There are a number of key differences between Hamas and the Republican Party that may explain why Hamas is more widely condemned as a terrorist organization.

* **Hamas has a long history of carrying out terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians.** These attacks have included suicide bombings, rocket attacks, and kidnappings. The Republican Party, on the other hand, has no history of carrying out terrorist attacks against American civilians.
* **Hamas is explicitly committed to the use of violence to achieve its political goals.** The Republican Party is not. In fact, the Republican Party platform explicitly condemns terrorism.
* **Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and other Western countries.** The Republican Party is not.

Some people argue that the Republican Party should be condemned as a terrorist organization for its attack on the United States Capitol on January 6th. They point out that the attack was an attempt to overturn the results of a democratic election and to undermine the American government. They also argue that the Republican Party's rhetoric and actions in the lead-up to the attack incited violence.

Others argue that the Republican Party should not be condemned as a terrorist organization. They point out that the attack on the Capitol was carried out by a small group of extremists and that the Republican Party as a whole does not support violence. They also argue that the Republican Party is a legitimate political party and that condemning it as a terrorist organization would be a dangerous precedent to set.

Ultimately, the question of whether Hamas and the Republican Party should be condemned as terrorist organizations is a matter of opinion. There are strong arguments to be made on both sides.

wahft2,"Conservatives of Reddit, can you offer a good, objective reason why the Electoral College should remain?","Democrats  argue that the EC needs to go because, if it were abolished, they would  win nearly every presidential election. To support this, they point to  the cast-iron objective fact that Democrats have indeed won the popular  vote for every election since 1990 *except* for 2004. Conservatives certainly cannot refute that fact; it is simply a fact and there's no two ways about it.

One  could further argue (although this much isn't a cast-iron objective  fact and is certainly up for debate) that the EC still indirectly caused  Republicans to win the 2004 election. After all, that was the first  election after 9/11, so Bush's ""America Fuck Yeah"" attitude against  terrorism was, at that specific point in time, just what the American  people needed. If that ""guns blazing"" attitude had been attempted at any  other point in American history (with maybe the exception of Pearl  Harbor, but FDR was still going to get re-elected anyway), it would have  backfired horribly.

But Bush was  only able to do that because he won the 2000 election ... an election he  only won because of the EC. If the popular vote were what counted, Bush  never would have gotten the chance to ""prove himself"" in the post-9/11  aftermath. In an alternate universe, where Gore won the 2000 election,  and in 2004, a new Republican candidate was going up against incumbent  Gore, Gore likely would have won due to it being HIM getting all the  credit for the post-9/11 response, just like how Democrat incumbent FDR got all the credit for his post-Pearl Harbor response.

So  while it isn't as much of a cast-iron objective fact as the democrats  winning the popular vote in every other election from 1990-onwards, the  case can still be made for the EC being to blame.

By  contrast, do conservatives have a good reason why the EC should stick  around? Is it truly just because the EC is the only way Republicans can  win presidential elections, and they know it?

x59o7m,The Trump Effect on polling and election results is fascinating. 2016/2020 were vastly different than 2018 and likely 2022.,"A pattern that is emerging is that Donald Trump has an effect on polling and election results. There appears to be this portion of voters that don't respond to pollsters, don't vote in midterms or special elections, but do vote for Donald Trump. In modern politics there is usually this third of the population that is completely absent from politics in anyway. They don't vote. They don't read the news. They're generally apolitical unless something extraordinary happens. Donald Trump was that exception. 

The 2016 polls had Hillary Clinton up against Donald Trump consistently. The margin wasn't massive, but consistent enough for people to believe that yes this was going to be a close election, but that Clinton was likely winning. On the Senate side, the pollsters overestimated the Democrats in races like Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania and Ron Johnson in Wisconsin. On the House side, the generic ballot overestimated Democrat support and while yes Republicans did lose seats - it wasn't nearly as many as the polls predicted. 

Similar things happened in 2020. It is true that Joe Biden did defeat Donald Trump, but the margin was a bit less than the polls predicted. Biden ended up winning narrow margins in five key swing states. It was enough to be the clear victor, but hardly a landslide. On the Senate side, the pollsters overestimated the Democrats again in races like Susan Collins in Maine and Thom Tillis in North Carolina. On the House side, the generic ballot overestimated Democratic support again. The margin was enough to keep the House for the Democrats, but not enough to expand or even preserve their gains from 2018. 

Contrast all this to the 2018 midterms. On the Senate side, the polls got the races pretty accurately. The only exception was Florida that was such a close race that no pollster could accurately predict it. Most had it correctly as a toss up. Indiana was a weird one, but the pollsters correctly had it as a tossup. On the House side, the generic ballot was pretty close. The difference was within the margin of error and as predicted the Democratic Party made big gains that year. 

My prediction is that the 2022 midterms will go along with these trends if they hold - the Democrats will keep the Senate and lose the House.

pmgkgy,Chris Christie — a possible 2024 presidential contender — takes direct aim at Trump,"Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie denounced former President Donald Trump in a speech Thursday night and said the GOP must rid itself of him and his cult of personality.

Christie, in a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., did not mention Trump’s name. But there was no question about who he was referring to as he described the Republican Party being dragged into a moment of “peril.”

He also directly confronted Trump’s insistence that he somehow won the 2020 election — a baseless conspiracy theory the former president and his allies have been promulgating since he lost to Joe Biden in November.

“Pretending we won when we lost is a waste of time, energy and credibility,” Christie said.

“We have to clear out the brush, on our own side and on theirs, before the fresh planting can begin,” he added.

The former governor, who ran for president in 2016, is thought to be mulling another run in 2024. And his Thursday speech was his first major attack on Trump and the former president's influence on the GOP, which he described as pernicious and detrimental to conservative goals.

The speech was also noteworthy in that Christie is the first possible 2024 contender to lay down a firm marker against Trump, who remains broadly popular among the Republican base.

Other possible 2024 candidates, such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, have studiously avoided knocking Trump, who is thought to be seriously considering another run for the presidency himself. Nikki Haley, who served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and is mulling her own White House bid, denounced Trump’s role in the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol earlier this year but quickly walked back those comments amid criticism from pro-Trump conservatives.

While denouncing Trump in his speech, Christie also tied himself to a very conventional set of GOP positions, implying that Republicans can win on policies pushed by the former president so long as they reject him and the fanaticism he inspires.

“We do not have to change our policies to win again,” he said. He talked at length about the “radical” agenda of Biden and the need to confront China, rein in spending, stand up for law and order, control migration across the southern border, fight back against liberal bias in the mainstream media and reduce the size of government.

But again and again in his speech, Christie returned to the themes of truth-telling and lies, implying that under Trump, the Republican Party had lost its way.

“All this lying has done harm to our nation, to our party and to ourselves,” he said.

Christie also took dead aim at Trump’s divisive rhetoric and habitual lying, which he said had warped the GOP.

“If the requirement in today’s politics for getting your support is to say a bunch of things that aren’t true — no, thank you. If it requires bending to the will of any one person rather than advocating ideas for the good of all people, then count me out. No man, no woman, no matter what office they’ve held or wealth they’ve acquired, are worthy of blind faith or obedience. That’s not who I am, and that’s not who we are as Republicans, no matter who is demanding that we tie our futures to a pile of lies. We deserve much better than to be misled by those trying to acquire or hold on to power,” he said.

Finally, and perhaps most significantly, Christie labeled Trumpism — again by inference and not directly — as an authoritarian movement, and rejected conservatives who have embraced foreign right-wing leaders like Hungary’s Viktor Orbán as role models.

“We have to reject those who try to lure us down rabbit holes, into alliances with bad actors, and over to the grip of authoritarianism. Authoritarian dictators are not strong leaders to be admired. They are bullies hoping to fool the crowd just one more time,” he said.

Christie also harked back to the Republican Party’s struggle with the John Birch Society, a far-right movement in the 1950s that pushed conspiracy theories and labeled President Dwight D. Eisenhower as a communist sympathizer. Mainstream Republicans fought back against the John Birch Society and other radicals and successfully purged them from the GOP, which helped pave the way for more palatable conservatives like Ronald Reagan to win the presidency.

Christie said this is another time when Republicans must “combat extremism” in their ranks.

“We need to discredit the extremists in our midst the way we have done before,” he said. “We need to renounce the conspiracy theorists and truth deniers, the ones who know better and the ones who are just plain nuts.”

That is a step that most in the GOP have avoided since Trump captured the party. And Christie, although a sometimes critic of Trump when he was president, also played a significant role in Trump's winning the nomination.

In 2016, Christie was blamed by some in the party for helping Trump by effectively knocking Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida out of the Republican nominating contest during the New Hampshire primary. As Rubio gained in the polls and gathered momentum, Christie went after him directly on the campaign trail, and then humiliated him in a televised debate three days before the Granite State voters went to the polls. Rubio’s campaign never recovered.

And Christie never turned his considerable prosecutorial skills — honed for six years as a U.S. attorney in New Jersey — against Trump, a decision that many in the GOP found puzzling and disturbing at the time. But the disappointment of Trump opponents in the GOP paled in comparison to their horror when Christie shocked the political world by endorsing Trump a few weeks after the New Hampshire primary. He was arguably the first truly influential establishment Republican to back him, giving the reality TV personality and businessman some much-needed credibility.

Christie was briefly in Trump’s inner circle during the campaign and was thought to be a contender for a Cabinet post but was effectively exiled by the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, according to Christie’s account. Christie had prosecuted Kushner’s father, the real estate baron Charles Kushner, for crimes that included a bizarre scheme to blackmail his own brother-in-law by sending him a prostitute, videotaping their sexual encounter and then using that tape against him.

Yet Christie remained an outside adviser to Trump for much of his presidency, and didn't fully break with him until after the Jan. 6 insurrection, which was sparked by Trump’s avalanche of lies about the voting results. Trump’s supporters, Christie told ABC News, launched their assault on the Capitol because they had been “lied to consistently by the president about a fraudulent election.”

Chris Christie denounced former President Donald Trump in a speech Thursday night and said the GOP must rid itself of him and his cult of personality.

Christie, in a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., did not mention Trump’s name. But there was no question about who he was referring to as he described the Republican Party being dragged into a moment of “peril.”

He also directly confronted Trump’s insistence that he somehow won the 2020 election — a baseless conspiracy theory the former president and his allies have been promulgating since he lost to Joe Biden in November.

“Pretending we won when we lost is a waste of time, energy and credibility,” Christie said.

“We have to clear out the brush, on our own side and on theirs, before the fresh planting can begin,” he added.

The former governor, who ran for president in 2016, is thought to be mulling another run in 2024. And his Thursday speech was his first major attack on Trump and the former president's influence on the GOP, which he described as pernicious and detrimental to conservative goals.

The speech was also noteworthy in that Christie is the first possible 2024 contender to lay down a firm marker against Trump, who remains broadly popular among the Republican base.

Other possible 2024 candidates, such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, have studiously avoided knocking Trump, who is thought to be seriously considering another run for the presidency himself. Nikki Haley, who served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and is mulling her own White House bid, denounced Trump’s role in the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol earlier this year but quickly walked back those comments amid criticism from pro-Trump conservatives.

While denouncing Trump in his speech, Christie also tied himself to a very conventional set of GOP positions, implying that Republicans can win on policies pushed by the former president so long as they reject him and the fanaticism he inspires.

“We do not have to change our policies to win again,” he said. He talked at length about the “radical” agenda of Biden and the need to confront China, rein in spending, stand up for law and order, control migration across the southern border, fight back against liberal bias in the mainstream media and reduce the size of government.

But again and again in his speech, Christie returned to the themes of truth-telling and lies, implying that under Trump, the Republican Party had lost its way.

“All this lying has done harm to our nation, to our party and to ourselves,” he said.

Christie also took dead aim at Trump’s divisive rhetoric and habitual lying, which he said had warped the GOP.

“If the requirement in today’s politics for getting your support is to say a bunch of things that aren’t true — no, thank you. If it requires bending to the will of any one person rather than advocating ideas for the good of all people, then count me out. No man, no woman, no matter what office they’ve held or wealth they’ve acquired, are worthy of blind faith or obedience. That’s not who I am, and that’s not who we are as Republicans, no matter who is demanding that we tie our futures to a pile of lies. We deserve much better than to be misled by those trying to acquire or hold on to power,” he said.

Finally, and perhaps most significantly, Christie labeled Trumpism — again by inference and not directly — as an authoritarian movement, and rejected conservatives who have embraced foreign right-wing leaders like Hungary’s Viktor Orbán as role models.

“We have to reject those who try to lure us down rabbit holes, into alliances with bad actors, and over to the grip of authoritarianism. Authoritarian dictators are not strong leaders to be admired. They are bullies hoping to fool the crowd just one more time,” he said.

Christie also harked back to the Republican Party’s struggle with the John Birch Society, a far-right movement in the 1950s that pushed conspiracy theories and labeled President Dwight D. Eisenhower as a communist sympathizer. Mainstream Republicans fought back against the John Birch Society and other radicals and successfully purged them from the GOP, which helped pave the way for more palatable conservatives like Ronald Reagan to win the presidency.

Christie said this is another time when Republicans must “combat extremism” in their ranks.

“We need to discredit the extremists in our midst the way we have done before,” he said. “We need to renounce the conspiracy theorists and truth deniers, the ones who know better and the ones who are just plain nuts.”

That is a step that most in the GOP have avoided since Trump captured the party. And Christie, although a sometimes critic of Trump when he was president, also played a significant role in Trump's winning the nomination.

In 2016, Christie was blamed by some in the party for helping Trump by effectively knocking Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida out of the Republican nominating contest during the New Hampshire primary. As Rubio gained in the polls and gathered momentum, Christie went after him directly on the campaign trail, and then humiliated him in a televised debate three days before the Granite State voters went to the polls. Rubio’s campaign never recovered.

And Christie never turned his considerable prosecutorial skills — honed for six years as a U.S. attorney in New Jersey — against Trump, a decision that many in the GOP found puzzling and disturbing at the time. But the disappointment of Trump opponents in the GOP paled in comparison to their horror when Christie shocked the political world by endorsing Trump a few weeks after the New Hampshire primary. He was arguably the first truly influential establishment Republican to back him, giving the reality TV personality and businessman some much-needed credibility.

Christie was briefly in Trump’s inner circle during the campaign and was thought to be a contender for a Cabinet post but was effectively exiled by the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, according to Christie’s account. Christie had prosecuted Kushner’s father, the real estate baron Charles Kushner, for crimes that included a bizarre scheme to blackmail his own brother-in-law by sending him a prostitute, videotaping their sexual encounter and then using that tape against him.

Yet Christie remained an outside adviser to Trump for much of his presidency, and didn't fully break with him until after the Jan. 6 insurrection, which was sparked by Trump’s avalanche of lies about the voting results. Trump’s supporters, Christie told ABC News, launched their assault on the Capitol because they had been “lied to consistently by the president about a fraudulent election.”

He said Trump had “violated his oath and betrayed the American people” by inciting the violent insurrection and then doing nothing for hours to quell the attack.

Gross Domestic Product

The United States is still the largest economy on earth, but many people don't fully grasp how this happened. For hundreds of years the top economies in the world were China and India. They didn't have the largest armies or technological prowess, but they had the most people. For the vast majority of human history economies were based on people making goods and it was a slow process. The technologies that did exist made life easier, however it wasn't enough to make geopolitical waves. That changed around the mid 19th century. The Industrial Revolution was already a hundred years in the making and technology had sped up so fast that countries with smaller populations could outpace larger ones on a geopolitical scale. This was something different. The country that benefited the most from this was the United States. It was so extreme that after the Second World War the United States had an economy vastly larger than any other country. So what changed?

Two things of note is that other countries started adapting to these knew technologies at a faster pace than the United States and the value of technological progress had reached an impasse. The current trends because of this are showing countries like China and India reclaiming their status as the top economies. Here's a short Youtube video that's interesting.

Changing Eras

In the United States we are in what some historians call the Neoliberal Era. So what is the Neoliberal Era? Well to understand the Neoliberal Era it's good to understand what it was against. For decades the United States had been operating under the New Deal framework. Economically speaking this had to do with Keynesian economics. Government would spend on social programs, big infrastructure projects and other things. This was accommodated by a high tax base on the wealthy that even the playing field somewhat. What happened is that there were people opposed to this framework. Government programs are expensive and they weren't all productive. The higher taxes limited business opportunities and many felt that infrastructure projects were more a state and local issue. This opposition culminated in the election of Ronald Reagan, but was really presented to the mainstream with the presidential run of Barry Goldwater. This new era offered a different view. Government would spend less on social programs and would tamper with large scale projects. Taxes would be lowered and there would be more deregulation. The US would turn to globalization and the primacy of the free market. At the time the rationale for this had a point. The economy did bounce in the 1980s and 1990s. Many of the excesses of pop culture that we remember fondly happened during this time. So what changed? A few things.

One was 9/11. The Neoliberal Era was definitely about cutting government spending, but not the military. The US at that point had been in numerous military adventures around the world including in Afghanistan in the 1980s as a proxy war with the Soviet Union. It wrecked the lives of many people there and some wanted revenge and turned to extremism. The 9/11 attacks shook the United States to its core, but it also led to excesses of a bloated military with no clear mission. Traditionally militaries were meant to defeat and conquer the bad guys, but what was asked in places in Afghanistan weren't clear. Was it nation building? Stopping extremism from forming? This led to enormous amounts of public dollars going overseas, many soldiers dying and an unhappy public.

Another event was the 2008 Financial Crisis. This event was led on by people in Wall Street betting on accounts in the housing sector assuming that that market was stable. It wasn't. The presumption was that people will pay there mortgage and when somebody fails it's a minority of people. The problem is that the US was having a debt problem. Since the mid 1970s jobs in many industries had been declining. Some of it was due to technology changes, jobs being shipped overseas and one sector that was hit particularly hard was the manufacturing sector. These jobs afforded many people a comfortable middle class life. When those jobs disappeared many people still wanted to maintain their lifestyle, but couldn't afford it. So they went into debt. This spiral had been developing for decades, but it wasn't until 2008 that the bubble crashed and many people's lives were ruined. So happened next?

Politically this led to the rise of populism that we're still feeling today. It started with more grassroots organization like Occupy Wall Street and The Tea Party Movement in the early 2010s, but morphed into national political figures with the election of Donald Trump and the presidential runs of Bernie Sanders.

I hope this explained some aspects of how the United States is declining. I'm not a fortune teller, but one thing I see is that as the US economy remains sluggish, the capacity to maintain a large military will decline. The Senate even recently had almost a quarter of the senators vote against the military budget which is unheard of. The political divisions will become more and more fierce where anarchy could break out prompting a dictator to quell the chaos. Alternatively this rise in populism could offer a constructive path that leads the US from the brink. An unpopular point unfortunately is that any change like that would require consent from the elite. Franklin Roosevelt was elected in the response to the Great Depression, but he himself was part of the elite. A New York blueblood, but he was intuitive. The offer was give up some of your wealth to reform society and avoid revolution. Th elites caved.

We'll see what happens this time.",1,2,0.9582,"The United States is in decline, however what is happening is rather complex. I should preface that I'm not going to focus on all of the variables on American decline since that would take multiple books, however I will explain some phenomenon.
